Here's a professional `README.md` for a folder or repository that contains **all your cloned projects and your own unique web applications** (such as your **Morning Wish App** or others). You can name the folder something like `web-projects`, `naveen-web-clones`, or any other name you prefer.

# 🌐 Naveen's Web Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of frontend development projects! This repository holds all the **website clones** I've built for practice, alongside a few **unique applications** I’ve created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Whether you're here to explore UI design, animation effects, or original functionality — you’ll find a variety of concepts implemented with clean, responsive code.
